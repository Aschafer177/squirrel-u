## Introduction
Lets take a closer look at the approach taken for accomplishing these goals with 
a brief review of the selected technologies. 

## Prerequisites

* None 

## Strategy
Thinking about the various products in the market, we thought that a Wikipedia 
style of information organization, curation and presentation worked well for 
CubeU, with a few adjustments. We wanted to tap into the brainpower and 
collaboration at Great American and find the right platform to do this.   

To fulfill our goals, We selected the GitHub Pages, Jekyll and Markdown as the 
mechanisms which we use as the foundation for CubeU. 

We created a hierarchy for content and a format for content pages.  
We ingested existing content in the form of Word documents and emails and then 
curated this content into CubeU. These contributions are divided into smaller 
text chapters and enhanced with images and examples.  

Later we will add more content along with packaged CUBE source / binary / script 
coding examples and short how-to videos. 

**Why aren't we using Jive?**  
Great question! Given the capabilities and goals we just mentioned, Jive falls  
short of providing some of the basic objectives that Cube U is striving to
achieve. Jive certainly has its place in the organization as a collaboration  
tool, but in fact provides a little too much flexibility. If you've had any  
experience with Jive, you'll know that anyone can contribute content for  
community viewing. This content doesn't necessarily meet any community-wide  
standards (because none exist), there is no assurance that similar content hasn't  
already been created, there is no guarantee that this information is accurate,  
up-to-date or relevant anymore and it is difficult to find after publishing.  
These are all issues that substantiate the use of GitHub to maintain this content  
over Jive. The same can be said for SharePoint and why we have decided not to use  
that medium for our Cube U space.

**Why aren't we using something like StackOverflow?**  
Another good question. As developers we are used to using Google which typically 
takes us into StackOverflow for possible answers. StackOverflow provides a wide 
ranging span and depth of solutions from across the worldwide development 
community. Users can contribute answers and up/down vote content. We looked 
carefully at similar solutions. The licensing for StackOverflow is not 
economical. The up/down voting is nice to quickly find solid answers. However 
these contributed answers can end up cluttering a page with less than useful 
information. We preferred a more direct approach where as an organization we 
strive for a clearly recommended statement of solution for a given problem. It 
does take away the social rewards aspect of contributing, but really the content 
is a product just like source code and we don't get special kudos for committing 
source code. The wiki style of contributing is more about asking and answering 
questions. The success of a Q&A based wiki is fueled by a high volume of content 
from all over the world. Given our smaller sized audience of contributors, we 
thought that creating a fixed taxonomy on a GitHub platform which we use every 
day for development would help provide structure to getting content created. 

## Future direction
We plan on incorporating more interactive collaboration tools into CubeU once we 
finish implementation of the platform and a solid content base. 

The use of GitHub as our content repository lends itself to the selection of the 
other components of the Cube U platform as we will review below.
