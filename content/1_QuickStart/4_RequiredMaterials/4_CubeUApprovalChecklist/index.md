## Guidelines (Things to Consider)

The following list summarizes some important considerations for contributors and approvers when creating, updating or reviewing content.
In general, these topics tend to be valid discussion points with potentially various outcomes. The expectation is that these considerations
should result in a healthy conversation between contributors, subject matter experts and approvers. Ultimately, the key is that
decisions are made in the best interest of the Cube U goals, maintaining the spirit of its existence.

Special considerations include, but are not limited to:

* Are valuable, meaningful and appropriate tags being used? Will people be able to find the content easily? See the "Tags" section of
**Front Matter Overview** for guidance on this.

* Consider the Cube U audience and personas. Is the documentation written with them in mind? Review the **About Cube U** and **Cube U Personas**
pages if you need more information about the in-scope audience for Cube U.

* Is the content appropriate for Cube U? Visit the **About Cube U** page for some guidance on what is considered appropriate
content for the Cube U space.

* Is the content placed in its area of best fit? If the contributor has placed the content in the Ground directory, the reviewer is
responsible for assisting them in determining where the content should be placed.

* Consider users of other Operating Systems.  Are there any specific differences in setup or support that need to be called out
in the documentation?

* Is the topic well-contained in a reasonably short chapter or is it better broken up into several chapters within a larger section?

* Is the content itself accurate?
