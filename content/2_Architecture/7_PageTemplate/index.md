## Introduction

Use **## Introduction** header and include a few sentences or paragraphs about 
the main topic, purpose of the document or any other high level information for 
the reader.  This section is mandatory.

The purpose of this document is to supply a "copy and paste" template to serve 
as a foundation for new content being created for Cube U.  Make sure you are
copying and pasting the source .md document, not the content as it is rendered 
on the Cube U site.

## Prerequisites

* Before you start contribute content, review the CubeU Contribution Guidelines. 
* Use the **## Prerequisites** header to include bullets about 
* Necessary downloads and installs and/or
* Knowledge a reader *must* already have to fully understand the content
* Note that content is not considered a "prerequisite" if just "good to know"
* "Good to know" content should be included in the "For Further Reading" section
* This section is mandatory *if* prerequisites are applicable

## Steps

Include the **## Steps** header if the content consists of a list of numbered 
steps to accomplish something.  

### 1. Short Step Title
Use **### Short Step Title**, using your own title, to label activities 
under **Steps**.  The title of the step above should be short and sweet to 
summarize what the step is.  Note that the title will appear in the Content list 
above.  

The actual details of the step will go under the step title and any following 
steps will be documented as outlined with progressing numeric values. 

**Lowest Sub-heading**

Any sub-headings under a step will be \*\*bolded** (no hashes). Make sure you 
add a line break between the sub-header and the content...otherwise, the content 
will run on right after the title.  Bolded sub-headers will *not* appear in the 
Content list.  

## Heading

Titles with two #'s (**## Title**) are used for the highest level topics your 
content will cover.  Use the headings and sub-headings as appropriate for your 
content.

### Sub-heading

Use **### Sub-heading** (replace with your own title) for topics subordinate to 
your Heading.  These headings will generate in the Content list as subordinates 
to the main header. 

#### Smaller Sub-heading

Use **#### Smaller Sub-heading** (replace with your own title) for topics 
subordinate to your Heading. These headings will generate in the Content list as 
subordinates to the sub-headings.

Note, if the content is too low of a level to make sense in the Content list, 
just \*\*bold** your **title** instead (as the "**Lowest Sub-heading**" above), 
so it will not show in the Content list. 

## For Further Reading

* Use **## For Further Reading** header to include bullets with links to 
* Other interesting, related or helpful topics
* Internal and external
