## Introduction
Contributing to Squirrel U is as easy as 1...2...3!  This Squirrel U Quick Start Guide will take you through the process of contributing to
Squirrel U via the GitHub interface.

## Prerequisites

* The only thing you need before you get started is access to GitHub.  Requesting access is very easy and usually has a
very quick turnaround time.  Just follow the steps under the **Request Access to GitHub (Our Source Code Repository)** section
of the **Required Access Requests for Squirrel** page for instructions on gaining access.  Under the **Request Description** step, you'll
just want to put "Please grant this user access to the BUE organization in GitHub"

## Start Contributing Today!

1. Create ("Fork") a personal copy of Squirrel U in GitHub

2. Create or update your content

3. Submit your content for review and approval ("Pull Request")

That's it!

## Want to contribute using IntelliJ?

Squirrel U's Quick Start Guide outlines the easiest and quickest way to start contributing to Squirrel U for the most generic user. However,
if you are a developer with an IDE such as IntelliJ, you may prefer to work in that environment. We have outlined how to
contribute directly from IntelliJ in the **How to Contribute to Squirrel U via IntelliJ** page.

## FAQ

**Why can't I just put my content in Jive like always?**

That's a great question!  There are actually several reasons that Squirrel U is the preferred medium for housing valuable content
related to Squirrel and the development space.  Take a look at the **Orientation** section of Squirrel U, namely the **About Squirrel U**
page, to learn more about the motivation and purpose behind Squirrel U's existence.

**Who is the audience for Squirrel U?**

As of this time, Squirrel U's main audience is developers on the Squirrel project.  This is not to say that other groups, roles and teams
can't use Squirrel U, but these are the users and contributors that are considered "in scope" for content at this time
