## Introduction

Welcome to Cube U, a learning site created for CUBE Developers to quickly obtain
the knowledge and information they need to deliver quality software in the CUBE 
software environment. 

Cube U is meant to be a collaborative site, where everyone cooperatively
contributes content to achieve these goals. Cube U's success depends on it...on
you! 

This section will give you some background as to the motivation, goals  
and approaches taken in creating CubeU. 

## Prerequisites

* None 

## Motivation

The CUBE program has accumulated tribal knowledge around internally developed 
software and practices. 

Various efforts have been made to capture some of this information into Word 
documents which have been distributed via email or placed into Jive. However, 
there are limitations to this existing collection of information: 

* **Incomplete** - this information is loosely connected leaving incomplete gaps.
* **Variation** - content is provided in varying styles, not necessarily easily 
  consumed. 
* **Limited Search** - inconsistent information tagging may make searches take too 
  long. Binary Word content cannot be searched (unlike Text based versions which 
  can be easily searched and compared). 
* **Unmaintainable** - Originals are left on developer machines with historical remnants 
  left unmaintained in Jive. 
* **Less secure** - Assets in Jive are not secured in a Great American hosted system.
* **Lack of reusability** - information cannot be easily reformatted for training or 
  presentation to various audiences. 
* **Unintended alterations** - Because much of the material is in Word (particularly 
  code examples), there are invalid characters inserted into the material when 
  pasted into a terminal. 

The motivation for this project is to address the above issues.

## Cube U Goals
