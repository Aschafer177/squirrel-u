## Introduction

Squirrel U's Quick Start Guide outlines the easiest and quickest way to start contributing to Squirrel U for the most generic of users.

Users without an IntelliJ licenses may find that the Atom Editor is a fitting alternative for editing and promoting Squirrel U changes.

Atom was created by the GitHub team and is supported by an active community of
plugin contributors. Atom does provide a nice development environment with
powerful plugins, such as Markdown linters. We are planning to package an Atom
setup for Squirrel.

## Prerequisites
* Setting up to contribute via IntelliJ starts with forking a copy of Squirrel U from GitHub as outlined in the **Create (Fork)
Your Copy of Squirrel U** page. Complete the steps as outlined on that page before continuing
