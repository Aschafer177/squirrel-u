### Tagging a Release <span class="octicon octicon-tag" style="font-size: 20px"></span>

You can tag a particular commit or object to refer to it in the future.  
By adding a tag you create a branch that never moves.  

This is primarily useful for marking released versions of repositories for later retrieval.  
Our Jenkins process manages tagging all repositories in Git and Maven.

Although Git supports tagging, it is very unlikely that you will need 
to directly tag a release.
