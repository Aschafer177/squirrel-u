## Introduction
Contributing to Cube U is as easy as 1...2...3!  This Cube U Quick Start Guide will take you through the process of contributing to
Cube U via the GitHub interface.

## Prerequisites

* The only thing you need before you get started is access to GitHub.  Requesting access is very easy and usually has a
very quick turnaround time.  Just follow the steps under the **Request Access to GitHub (Our Source Code Repository)** section
of the **Required Access Requests for CUBE** page for instructions on gaining access.  Under the **Request Description** step, you'll
just want to put "Please grant this user access to the BUE organization in GitHub"

## Start Contributing Today!

1. Create ("Fork") a personal copy of Cube U in GitHub

2. Create or update your content

3. Submit your content for review and approval ("Pull Request")

That's it!

## Want to contribute using IntelliJ?

Cube U's Quick Start Guide outlines the easiest and quickest way to start contributing to Cube U for the most generic user. However,
if you are a developer with an IDE such as IntelliJ, you may prefer to work in that environment. We have outlined how to
contribute directly from IntelliJ in the **How to Contribute to Cube U via IntelliJ** page.

## FAQ

**Why can't I just put my content in Jive like always?**

That's a great question!  There are actually several reasons that Cube U is the preferred medium for housing valuable content
related to CUBE and the development space.  Take a look at the **Orientation** section of Cube U, namely the **About Cube U**
page, to learn more about the motivation and purpose behind Cube U's existence.

**Who is the audience for Cube U?**

As of this time, Cube U's main audience is developers on the CUBE project.  This is not to say that other groups, roles and teams
can't use Cube U, but these are the users and contributors that are considered "in scope" for content at this time
